# [Marionetta][homepage] is a ruby library for executing
# commands on one or more remote machines via SSH.
# 
# It provides puppet provisioning without the need for a
# puppet master and can also deploy your application code
# (with rollbacks) via rsync. With a RakeHelper you can
# integrate it into your workflow with ease.
# 
# Installing the gem is the best way to start using
# Marionetta. You can do this from command line:
# 
#     gem install marionetta
# 
# Or â€“ better yet â€“ in your Gemfile:
# 
#     source 'http://rubygems.org'
#     gem 'marionetta'

# pull requests.

  ### Defining Servers

  # In order to connect to servers you must define configs for
  # each. This method provides a default hash describing some
  # common settings including command binaries, default flags
  # and more.
  # 
  # One interesting this to note is a logger is set, pointing
  # to `STDOUT`.
  # 
  # Do not get too caught up in this method, it is called
  # elsewhere in Marionetta where you can better define your
  # servers. You should consult this method in order to see
  # the defaults.
  # 
  # Any place in this library you see a variable called
  # `server` you can be certain it is a server hash.
